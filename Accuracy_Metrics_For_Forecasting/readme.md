# <span style="color:blue">Assessment of Accuracy Metrics for Time Series Forecasting</span>

Forecasting plays a pivotal role in industry by providing critical insights and foresight. It enables efficient resource allocation, cost reduction, and demand planning. Industries rely on forecasts for optimizing inventory, enhancing supply chain efficiency, and making informed decisions in areas like finance, marketing, and risk management. Accurate forecasting empowers businesses to adapt to changing market dynamics, ensuring competitiveness and sustainability in today's dynamic business landscape.

This repository contains code and resources for an article that addresses the challenge of evaluating forecast accuracy. We perform a time series forecasting using the StatsForecast library developed by Nixtla and discuss various Accuracy Metrics along with their mathematical interpretations and advantages.

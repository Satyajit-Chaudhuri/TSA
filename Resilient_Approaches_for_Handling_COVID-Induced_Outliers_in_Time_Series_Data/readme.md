# Resilient Approaches for Mitigating COVID-Induced Fluctuations in Time Series Data

## 🌐 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted sales trends significantly. This repository explores innovative approaches using LSTM-based Neural Networks to address outlier sequences in sales data influenced by the pandemic.

## 🛠️ Algorithms Used
- LSTM-based Neural Networks

## 📊 Approach 1: Replacement with Forecasted Values
Utilizing data until February 2020, LSTM forecasts for the following 20 months are generated. These forecasts replace actual values, refining predictive accuracy and adapting to evolving market trends.

✅ **Results:** Enhanced reliability with significantly reduced Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values.

## 📈 Approach 2: Replacement with Past Year Values
Substituting sales figures from 2019 for pandemic-affected data between March 2020 and October 2021. This approach offers insights into pandemic-induced deviations for robust forecasting evaluations.

✨ **Insights:** Substantial reduction in MAPE values, indicating improved predictive accuracy amidst pandemic-induced fluctuations.

# <center> Aluminum Price Forecast using Time Series Analysis </center>


## Background:

India has made huge strides in building renewable energy capacity and ranks fourth globally in terms of overall renewable energy capacity. As of May 2021, we have 95.6 gigawatts (GW) of installed renewable energy capacity, almost half of which (41 GW) is solar energy.In April 2021, the government approved the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the solar PV manufacturing sector, with INR 4500 crore (US$603 million) allocated by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) for investment in high-efficiency solar PV modules.(Source: https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/14/no-excuses-india-must-ramp-up-solar-manufacturing-to-reduce-reliance-on-imports/)

The PV Module manufacturing sector has seen a exponential growth in the recent years and thus to be more competitive in terms of module cost/Wp, they have focussed on increasing their Supply Chain Efficiency. The module manufacturing companies are highly dependent on foreign sources (mainly China) for the raw materials. Various raw materials like the Solar Cells, EVA, Backsheet, JBs and aluminium frames are imported from the foreign countries. The constant reliance on imports mean higher TATs in procurement and thus the companies have been investing on devising forecasting processes to gain an advantage in terms of cost and lead times.



## Business Case:

Due to the festive holidays in India in Novemeber and December and the Chinese New Year in middle January, manufacturing gets delayed and vessel spaces become a problem in Ocean Logistics and hence the TAT may go upto 90 days from the normal 60 days.

Hence the Solar Company conducting the study wishes to **Predict** the prices of Aluminum Ingot during the upcoming months. The Aluminum ingot is the principle component of Aluminum frames which forms a significant price of the overall PV Module. The company has an option to bulk purchase the aluminum ingots and ask their suppliers to do the fabrication and process staggered deliveries as per the Purchase Orders. So the company management wishes to check whether bulk purchase of Aluminum ingot would be a more cost efficient option or should they wait to procure at the market price.
